This bot is not as good as @junction_bot, but it does it's job

the main thing of this bot is that you don't have to pay for unlimited number of channels, unlike in [@junction_bot](https://t.me/junction_bot), 
because we didn't set up payment :)

But also because you can set up this bot on your machine.

For that you need to:
1. have python â‰¥ 3.9;
2. [setup mongodb](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-mongodb-a4ce205e7739/) so that it's available on localhost;
3. Clone this repo and `cd` into it; 
4. install requirement via `pip3 install --user .` or if you have poetry `poetry install`;
5. launch bot via `TG_API_HASH=INSERT_TELEGRAM_API_HASH TG_BOT_TOKEN=INSERT_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN TG_API_ID=INSERT_TELEGRAM_API_ID run_channel_bot` (or you can copy `.env.example` into `.env` file and insert your credentials there)
   2. `TG_API_HASH` and `TG_API_ID` you can get from [telegram website](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id).
   3. `TG_BOT_TOKEN` you can get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

If it's not obvious, we collect some data from users. In fact, we collect users ids and channels that they subscribe to. That data is required to make this application possible.
